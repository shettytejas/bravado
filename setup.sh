# TODO: Complete the entire setup!

# This file should:
# - Install all the Setup specific requirements if not exists?
# - Pull the latest code from the repository or pull the latest docker image.
# - Install docker if not already installed?
# - Create a storage volume if not already exists?
# - Build the image (if pulling repo) or skip this step.
# - Run a new container with the latest image, and replace it with the older image.
# - End the script with a success message.
