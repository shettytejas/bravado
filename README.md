# Bravado

## Your very own, personal athletics coach.

#### Currently, Bravado is in early development. It's not ready for production use. I'm working on it in my spare time, so progress is slow. If you're interested in using Bravado, please check back later.

Bravado is an open-source, self-hosted athletics coach. It's designed to help you train for your next race, whether it's a 5k, a marathon, or something in between.

Currently, Bravado focuses on running. In the future, I plan to add support for other sports, such as cycling and swimming.

Bravado, is open-source, and is meant to be a PWA alternative to Strava and other similar services. It's designed to be self-hosted. This means that you can run it on your own server, and you can be sure that your data is safe and secure.

## Planned Features
1. AI Integration (for much better coaching)
2. Health Statistics
3. ActivityPub (or an alternative) for federated sharing with other Bravado instances
4. Support for other sports (cycling, swimming, etc.)
5. More visual graphs and charts!

## Development

Bravado is a Ruby on Rails 8 application. It uses Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI for styling.
